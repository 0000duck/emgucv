##Emgu CV is a wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library. 

With our Open Source Windows release reaching [10,000 download/month](https://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/files/emgucv/stats/timeline), Emgu CV is probably the most used C# interface for OpenCV. Now it has finally arrived to the Xamarin Component Store.
