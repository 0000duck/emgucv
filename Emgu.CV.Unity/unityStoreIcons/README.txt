Extra Instructions for iOS build
--------------------------------------------
After the XCode project for iOS is generated by Unity, a few extra configuration steps are required:
1. Open XCode. From the File > Open... menu, open the XCode project that you created. It will be a file called {xxx}.xcodeproj inside the directory you just saved under in the last section.
Select the Unity iPhone project by clicking on it.
2. In the project menu bar, click on Build Settings to open that section.
3. Expand "Apple LLVM 6.1 - Language - C++"
4. In "C++ Standard Library", choose "libstdc++ (GNU C++ standard Library)".
5. In the project menu bar, click on Build Phases to open that section.
6. Expand the Link Binary With Libraries list. 
7. At the very bottom of the Link Binary With Libraries list, click the + sign. This opens a window that says "Choose frameworks and libraries to add:".
8. Type libc++ into the search box. When libc++ appears, double-click on it to add it to the libraries.

Now run the project, either by clicking the play button, or by going to Product > Run.
